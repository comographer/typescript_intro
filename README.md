## 1.5 Why not Javascript

- Typescript provides type safety to regular JS
- This helps JS developers to have much better and safer development experience
- Runtime Errors are errors that happen while the code is being run
- With JS, it can be a challenge to prevent a runtime error where as TS will help you prevent it by not compiling code that could have a runtime error
